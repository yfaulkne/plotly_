##### Please see the below link to the module 12 project in which a dashboard had to be created.
##### In this dashboard you will find a drop-down menu of different volunteers used in a study of belly button bacteria for the company Improbable Beef.
##### Improbable Beef is looking for specific belly button bacteria to manufacture a synthetic beef. Once Improbable Beef identifies the bacteria that they need for the synthetic beef, the candidates in the study can utilize the dashboard to see if they qualify as a potential candidate for the manufacturing.
##### Each person is represented by their Test Subject ID number. After selecting an ID number from the drop-down menu, that person's demographics will show including their ethinicity, gender, location, belly button type, and the frequecy of which they washed their belly buttons.
##### Also, to the right and below each person's demographics, three charts are shown:
#####  1. Chart 1 represents the top 10 bacteria found in that person's belly button.
#####  2. Chart 2 is a gauge chart that represents the frequecy that the person washed their belly button.
#####  3. Chart 3 is a bubble cahrt that shows the bacteria cultures per sample of each bacteria in the belly button.
